<p>In the future, I would like to improve my art and hopefully be able to sell it. Although I am not sure I want to pursue an art career in the future I am hopeful that I will be able to. I am also very interested in the historical aspect of art and would be interested in most likely minoring it in college. I would like to major something in history as well if I do not pursue art.I am interested in applying to the art school in downtown Columbus, CCAD.</p>
